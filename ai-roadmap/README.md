# AI Engineer Study Roadmap — Modern UI

This is a standalone, static roadmap page you can open locally.

Files:
- index.html — main page
- style.css — styling
- script.js — dynamic rendering, progress persistence

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. Mark checklist items — progress is saved locally in your browser.
3. Use the search box to filter topics. Click `Reset progress` to clear saved state.

Notes:
- No backend required; everything uses browser `localStorage`.
- To share progress between devices, export/implement sync manually.

Enjoy learning! ✨
